# Factors shaping Data Science

## Objective
The project aims to understand the underlying reasons for the success and failure of data science initiatives by analyzing a collection of news articles related to Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence.

## Skills/Tools Used :
1. Python programming language
2. Natural Language Processing
3. Text cleaning
4. Named Entity Recognition
5. Topic Modelling
6. Sentiment Analysis
   
## Project Overview

**1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
   - A dataset containing news articles on Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI was provided by my University that I am studying in (University of Chicago).
   - Noise Cleaning :
       - Lowercasing
       - Removed HTML tags, URLs and web crawl remnants
       - Removed punctuations and digits
       - Removed symbols and non-printable characters
       - Removed newlines, tabs and extra white spaces
    - Pre-processing :
       - Removed stopwords
       - Lemmatization using WordNetLemmatizer()

**2. Topic Detection:**
   - Use topic modeling techniques to categorize articles into major themes or topics.
   - Assign each article to the appropriate topic for analysis.

**3. Sentiment Analysis:**
   - Perform sentiment analysis to determine the sentiment (positive, negative) expressed in the articles.
   - Customize sentiment analysis to fit the context of data science initiatives.

**4. Reasons for Failure:**
   - Identify articles with negative sentiment discussing failures in data science projects.
   - Extract reasons for these failures, such as technology issues, data challenges, or project management problems.

**5. Reasons for Success:**
   - Identify articles with positive sentiment discussing achivements in data science projects.
   - Extract reasons for these achievements

**6. Sentiment Over Time Analysis:**
   - Create a timeline to visualize how sentiment changes over different time periods.
   - Investigate whether sentiment patterns align with specific events or technological advancements.

**7. Entity Identification:**
   - Use Named Entity Recognition to identify organizations, people, and locations mentioned in the articles.
   - Compile a list of these entities for further analysis.

**8. Targeted Sentiment Analysis:**
   - Analyze the sentiment associated with specific entities mentioned in the articles.
   - Determine how organizations and people are portrayed in the context of data science projects.

**9. Insights and Recommendations:**
   - Analyze the reasons for failure and success to extract insights.
   - Develop actionable recommendations to enhance the success rates of data science initiatives.
   
**10. Visualizing Insights:**
    - Create visualizations, like word clouds or bubble charts, to summarize the recommendations and insights.

**11. Presenting Success Stories and Mistakes to Avoid:**
    - Identify articles highlighting successful data science initiatives.
    - Extract reasons contributing to their success.
    - Identify common mistakes and pitfalls that should be avoided.

**12. Final Presentation:**
    - Create a professional PowerPoint presentation summarizing the project.
    - Include an executive summary, methodology, key findings, actionable recommendations, and visualizations.
    - Ensure clarity, logical flow, and appropriate design to engage the business audience.
